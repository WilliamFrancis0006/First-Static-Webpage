To Whom it may concern,

This is my first attempt to design a webpage and my first time coding with HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

This project took roughly 2 days and I am very happy with the result.

It contains:
	Four total html pages with similar and differnt layouts and displays combined with 5 image files
	One CSS file for the appearance and hover/scale functionality for a more enjoyable experience and
 	Two javascript files for the JQuery Libraby for the random number multiplication and the 
	string matching function to approve a user input.

Thanks for your time,
William Francis
